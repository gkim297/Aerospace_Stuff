DES 3 was detected as a stellar overdensity in\\\\nfirst-year Dark Energy Survey data, and confirmed with deeper photometry from\\\\nthe 4.1 metre Southern Astrophysical Research (SOAR) telescope. The new system\\\\nwas detected with a relatively high significance and appears in the DES images\\\\nas a compact concentration of faint blue point sources. We determine that DES 3\\\\nis located at a heliocentric distance of $\\\\\\\\sim 76\\\\\\\\,\\\\\\\\mathrm{kpc}$ and it is\\\\ndominated by an old ($\\\\\\\\simeq 9.8\\\\\\\\,\\\\\\\\mathrm{Gyr}$) and metal-poor\\\\n($\\\\\\\\mathrm{[Fe/H]}\\\\\\\\simeq -1.88$) population. While the age and metallicity\\\\nvalues of DES 3 are similar to globular clusters, its half-light radius\\\\n($r_\\\\\\\\mathrm{h}\\\\\\\\sim 6.5\\\\\\\\,\\\\\\\\mathrm{pc}$) and luminosity ($M_V \\\\\\\\sim -1.9$) are more\\\\nindicative of faint star clusters. Based on the apparent angular size, DES 3,\\\\nwith a value of $r_\\\\\\\\mathrm{h}\\\\\\\\sim 0.\\\\\\\\!^{\\\\\\\\prime}3$, is among the smallest faint\\\\nstar clusters known to date. Furthermore, using deeper imaging of DES\\\\nJ0222.7$-$5217 taken with the SOAR telescope, we update structural parameters\\\\nand perform the first isochrone modeling. Our analysis yields the first age\\\\n($\\\\\\\\simeq 12.6\\\\\\\\,\\\\\\\\mathrm{Gyr}$) and metallicity ($\\\\\\\\mathrm{[Fe/H]}\\\\\\\\simeq -2.01$)\\\\nestimates for this object. The half-light radius ($r_\\\\\\\\mathrm{h}\\\\\\\\sim\\\\n10.5\\\\\\\\,\\\\\\\\mathrm{pc}$) and luminosity ($M_V\\\\\\\\sim -2.7$) of DES J0222.7$-$5217\\\\nsuggest that it is likely a faint star cluster. The discovery of DES 3\\\\nindicates that the census of stellar systems in the Milky Way is still far from\\\\ncomplete, and demonstrates the power of modern wide-field imaging surveys to\\\\nimprove our knowledge of the Galaxy\\'s satellite population.\\\\n\",\\r\\n        \"update_date\": \"2018-05-02\"\\r\\n    },\\r\\n    {\\r\\n        \"id\": \"2203.06130\",\\r\\n        \"authors\": \"Julie E M McGeoch and Malcolm W McGeoch\",\\r\\n        \"authors_parsed\": [\\r\\n            [\\r\\n                \"McGeoch\",\\r\\n                \"Julie E M\",\\r\\n                \"\"\\r\\n            ],\\r\\n            [\\r\\n                \"McGeoch\",\\r\\n                \"Malcolm W\",\\r\\n                \"\"\\r\\n            ]\\r\\n        ],\\r\\n        \"title\": \"Chiral 480nm absorption in the hemoglycin space polymer\",\\r\\n        \"doi\": null,\\r\\n        \"categories\": \"physics.chem-ph astro-ph.EP\",\\r\\n        \"abstract\": \"  A 1494 Dalton hemoglycin space polymer of Glycine18 Hydroxy-glycine4 Fe2O4\\\\ntermed the core unit is part of a polymer of Glycine, Si, Fe and O that forms\\\\ntubes, vesicles and a lattice structure isolated from CV3 meteorites and\\\\ncharacterized by mass spectrometry, FIB/SIMS and X-ray analysis.

Observations of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) can be used to derive\\\\\\\\naccurate cosmological distances through empirical standardization techniques.\\\\\\\\nDespite this success neither the progenitors of SNe Ia nor the explosion\\\\\\\\nprocess are fully understood. The U-band region has been less well observed for\\\\\\\\nnearby SNe, due to technical challenges, but is the most readily accessible\\\\\\\\nband for high-redshift SNe.\\\\\\\\n  Aims. Using spectrophotometry from the Nearby Supernova Factory, we study the\\\\\\\\norigin and extent of U-band spectroscopic variations in SNe Ia and explore\\\\\\\\nconsequences for their standardization and the potential for providing new\\\\\\\\ninsights into the explosion process.\\\\\\\\n  Methods. We divide the U-band spectrum into four wavelength regions\\\\\\\\n{\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\lambda}(uNi), {\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\lambda}(uTi), {\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\lambda}(uSi) and {\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\lambda}(uCa). Two of these\\\\\\\\nspan the Ca H&K {\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\lambda}{\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\lambda} 3934, 3969 complex. We employ spectral\\\\\\\\nsynthesis using SYNAPPS to associate the two bluer regions with Ni/Co and Ti.\\\\\\\\n  Results. (1) The flux of the uTi feature is an extremely sensitive\\\\\\\\ntemperature/luminosity indicator, standardizing the SN peak luminosity to 0.116\\\\\\\\n$\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\pm$ 0.011 mag RMS. A traditional SALT2.4 fit on the same sample yields a\\\\\\\\n0.135 mag RMS. Standardization using uTi also reduces the difference in\\\\\\\\ncorrected magnitude between SNe originating from different host galaxy\\\\\\\\nenvironments. (2) Early U-band spectra can be used to probe the Ni+Co\\\\\\\\ndistribution in the ejecta, thus offering a rare window into the source of\\\\\\\\nlightcurve power. (3) The uCa flux further improves standardization, yielding a\\\\\\\\n0.086 $\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\pm$ 0.010 mag RMS without the need to include an additional intrinsic\\\\\\\\ndispersion to reach {\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\chi}$^2$/dof $\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\sim$ 1. This reduction in RMS is partially\\\\\\\\ndriven by an improved standardization of Shallow Silicon and 91T-like SNe.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\", \\\\\"update_date\\\\\": \\\\\"2018-06-20\\\\\"}, {\\\\\"id\\\\\": \\\\\"1004.4907\\\\\", \\\\\"authors\\\\\": \\\\\"Gretchen L.

All-sky searches for continuous\\\\\\\\ngravitational waves from unknown sources are computationally limited. The\\\\\\\\nsemi-coherent approach reduces the computational cost by dividing the entire\\\\\\\\nobservation timespan into short segments to be analyzed coherently, then\\\\\\\\ncombined together incoherently. Semi-coherent analyses that attempt to improve\\\\\\\\nsensitivity by coherently combining data from multiple detectors face a\\\\\\\\ncomputational challenge in accounting for uncertainties in signal parameters.\\\\\\\\nIn this article, we lay out a technique to meet this challenge using summed\\\\\\\\nFourier transform coefficients. Applying this technique to one all-sky search\\\\\\\\nalgorithm called TwoSpect, we confirm that the sensitivity of all-sky,\\\\\\\\nsemi-coherent searches can be improved by coherently combining the short data\\\\\\\\nsegments. For misaligned detectors, however, this improvement requires careful\\\\\\\\nattention when marginalizing over unknown polarization parameters. In addition,\\\\\\\\ncare must be taken in correcting for differential detector velocity due to the\\\\\\\\nEarth\\'s rotation for high signal frequencies and widely separated detectors.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\", \\\\\"update_date\\\\\": \\\\\"2016-04-13\\\\\"}, {\\\\\"id\\\\\": \\\\\"1806.00532\\\\\", \\\\\"authors\\\\\": \\\\\"J.

IX. Systematic comparison between lens modelling software\\\\\\\\n  programs: time delay prediction for WGD 2038$-$4008\\\\\", \\\\\"doi\\\\\": null, \\\\\"categories\\\\\": \\\\\"astro-ph.CO\\\\\", \\\\\"abstract\\\\\": \\\\\"  The importance of alternative methods to measure the Hubble constant such as\\\\\\\\ntime-delay cosmography is highlighted by the recent Hubble tension. It is\\\\\\\\nparamount to thoroughly investigate and rule out systematic biases in all\\\\\\\\nmeasurement methods before we can accept new physics as the source of this\\\\\\\\ntension. In this study, we perform a check for systematic biases in the lens\\\\\\\\nmodelling procedure of time-delay cosmography by comparing independent and\\\\\\\\nblind time-delay predictions of the system WGD 2038$-$4008 from two teams using\\\\\\\\ntwo different software programs: Glee and lenstronomy. The predicted time\\\\\\\\ndelays from both teams incorporate the stellar kinematics of the deflector and\\\\\\\\nthe external convergence from line-of-sight structures. The unblinded\\\\\\\\ntime-delay predictions from the two teams agree within $1.2\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\sigma$ implying\\\\\\\\nthat once the time delay is measured the inferred Hubble constant will also be\\\\\\\\nmutually consistent. However, there is a $\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\sim$4$\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\sigma$ discrepancy between\\\\\\\\nthe power-law model slope and external shear, which is a significant\\\\\\\\ndiscrepancy at the level of lens models before incorporating the stellar\\\\\\\\nkinematics and the external convergence. We identify the difference in the\\\\\\\\nreconstructed point spread function (PSF) to be the source of this discrepancy.\\\\\\\\nIf the same reconstructed PSF is used by both teams, then we achieve excellent\\\\\\\\nagreement within $\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\sim$0.6$\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\sigma$, indicating that potential systematics\\\\\\\\nstemming from source reconstruction algorithms and investigator choices are\\\\\\\\nwell under control. We recommend future studies to supersample the PSF as\\\\\\\\nneeded and marginalize over multiple algorithms/realizations for the PSF\\\\\\\\nreconstruction to mitigate the systematic associated with the PSF. A future\\\\\\\\nstudy will measure the time delays of the system WGD 2038$-$4008 and infer the\\\\\\\\nHubble constant based on our mass models.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\", \\\\\"update_date\\\\\": \\\\\"2022-02-24\\\\\"}, {\\\\\"id\\\\\": \\\\\"1706.09630\\\\\", \\\\\"authors\\\\\": \\\\\"A.

The gauge symmetry $U(1)_{\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\psi\\'}$, also\\\\\\\\nknown as $U(1)_N$, is a linear combination of the $U(1)_\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\chi$ and $U(1)_\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\psi$\\\\\\\\nsubgroups of $E_6$. The model predicts the existence of three sterile neutrinos\\\\\\\\nwith masses $\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\lesssim 0.1~{\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rm eV}$, if the $U(1)_{\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\psi\\'}$ breaking scale is of\\\\\\\\norder 10 TeV. Their contribution to the effective number of neutrinos at\\\\\\\\nnucleosynthesis is $\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\Delta N_{\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nu}\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\simeq 0.29$. The model can provide a variety\\\\\\\\nof possible cold dark matter candidates including the lightest sterile\\\\\\\\nsneutrino. If the $U(1)_{\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\psi\\'}$ breaking scale is increased to $10^3~{\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rm\\\\\\\\nTeV}$, the sterile neutrinos, which are stable on account of a $Z_2$ symmetry,\\\\\\\\nbecome viable warm dark matter candidates. The observed value of the standard\\\\\\\\nmodel Higgs boson mass can be obtained with relatively light stop quarks thanks\\\\\\\\nto the D-term contribution from $U(1)_{\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\psi\\'}$. The model predicts diquark and\\\\\\\\ndiphoton resonances which may be found at an updated LHC. The well-known $\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\mu$\\\\\\\\nproblem is resolved and the observed baryon asymmetry of the universe can be\\\\\\\\ngenerated via leptogenesis. The breaking of $U(1)_{\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\psi\\'}$ produces\\\\\\\\nsuperconducting strings that may be present in our galaxy. A $U(1)$ R symmetry\\\\\\\\nplays a key role in keeping the proton stable and providing the light sterile\\\\\\\\nneutrinos.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\", \\\\\"update_date\\\\\": \\\\\"2017-11-01\\\\\"}, {\\\\\"id\\\\\": \\\\\"1211.1173\\\\\", \\\\\"authors\\\\\": \\\\\"The MAGIC Collaboration: J.

We study\\\\ngravito-turbulence and its associated spiral structure in thin gaseous disks\\\\nsubject to a prescribed cooling law. We characterize the morphology, coherence,\\\\nand propagation of the spirals and examine when the flow deviates from viscous\\\\ndisk models. We used the finite-volume code Pluto to integrate the equations of\\\\nself-gravitating hydrodynamics in three-dimensional spherical geometry. The gas\\\\nwas cooled over longer-than-orbital timescales to trigger the gravitational\\\\ninstability and sustain turbulence. We ran models for various disk masses and\\\\ncooling rates. In all cases considered, the turbulent gravitational stress\\\\ntransports angular momentum outward at a rate compatible with viscous disk\\\\ntheory. The dissipation of orbital energy happens via shocks in spiral density\\\\nwakes, heating the disk back to a marginally stable thermal equilibrium. These\\\\nwakes drive vertical motions and contribute to mix material from the disk with\\\\nits corona. They are formed and destroyed intermittently, and they nearly\\\\ncorotate with the gas at every radius. As a consequence, large-scale spiral\\\\narms exhibit no long-term global coherence, and energy thermalization is an\\\\nessentially local process. In the absence of radial substructures or tidal\\\\nforcing, and provided a local cooling law, gravito-turbulence reduces to a\\\\nlocal phenomenon in thin gaseous disks.\\\\n\",\\r\\n        \"update_date\": \"2021-06-09\"\\r\\n    },\\r\\n    {\\r\\n        \"id\": \"1206.1254\",\\r\\n        \"authors\": \"Jelte T.

We find that a dust model including micron-sized\\\\ngraphite grains can reproduce the observed spectrum with the dust feature\\\\nfairly well.\\\\n\",\\r\\n        \"update_date\": \"2015-06-05\"\\r\\n    },\\r\\n    {\\r\\n        \"id\": \"2106.05284\",\\r\\n        \"authors\": \"Tobias Nadolny, Ruth Durrer, Martin Kunz and Hamsa Padmanabhan\",\\r\\n        \"authors_parsed\": [\\r\\n            [\\r\\n                \"Nadolny\",\\r\\n                \"Tobias\",\\r\\n                \"\"\\r\\n            ],\\r\\n            [\\r\\n                \"Durrer\",\\r\\n                \"Ruth\",\\r\\n                \"\"\\r\\n            ],\\r\\n            [\\r\\n                \"Kunz\",\\r\\n                \"Martin\",\\r\\n                \"\"\\r\\n            ],\\r\\n            [\\r\\n                \"Padmanabhan\",\\r\\n                \"Hamsa\",\\r\\n                \"\"\\r\\n            ]\\r\\n        ],\\r\\n        \"title\": \"A new way to test the Cosmological Principle: measuring our peculiar\\\\n  velocity and the large scale anisotropy independently\",\\r\\n        \"doi\": \"10.1088/1475-7516/2021/11/009\",\\r\\n        \"categories\": \"astro-ph.CO gr-qc\",\\r\\n        \"abstract\": \"  We present a novel approach to disentangle two key contributions to the\\\\nlargest-scale anisotropy of the galaxy distribution: (i) the intrinsic dipole\\\\ndue to clustering and anisotropic geometry, and (ii) the kinematic dipole due\\\\nto our peculiar velocity.

The kinetic luminosity\\\\nand momentum carried by such outflows would be sufficient to provide\\\\nsignificant feedback.\\\\n\",\\r\\n        \"update_date\": \"2013-10-02\"\\r\\n    },\\r\\n    {\\r\\n        \"id\": \"2011.14998\",\\r\\n        \"authors\": \"Frederik De Ceuster, Jan Bolte, Ward Homan, Silke Maes, Jolien\\\\n  Malfait, Leen Decin, Jeremy Yates, Peter Boyle, and James Hetherington\",\\r\\n        \"authors_parsed\": [\\r\\n            [\\r\\n                \"De Ceuster\",\\r\\n                \"Frederik\",\\r\\n                \"\"\\r\\n            ],\\r\\n            [\\r\\n                \"Bolte\",\\r\\n                \"Jan\",\\r\\n                \"\"\\r\\n            ],\\r\\n            [\\r\\n                \"Homan\",\\r\\n                \"Ward\",\\r\\n                \"\"\\r\\n            ],\\r\\n            [\\r\\n                \"Maes\",\\r\\n                \"Silke\",\\r\\n                \"\"\\r\\n            ],\\r\\n            [\\r\\n                \"Malfait\",\\r\\n                \"Jolien\",\\r\\n                \"\"\\r\\n            ],\\r\\n            [\\r\\n                \"Decin\",\\r\\n                \"Leen\",\\r\\n                \"\"\\r\\n            ],\\r\\n            [\\r\\n                \"Yates\",\\r\\n                \"Jeremy\",\\r\\n                \"\"\\r\\n            ],\\r\\n            [\\r\\n                \"Boyle\",\\r\\n                \"Peter\",\\r\\n                \"\"\\r\\n            ],\\r\\n            [\\r\\n                \"Hetherington\",\\r\\n                \"James\",\\r\\n                \"\"\\r\\n            ]\\r\\n        ],\\r\\n        \"title\": \"Magritte, a modern software library for 3D radiative transfer: II.\\\\n  Adaptive ray-tracing, mesh construction and reduction\",\\r\\n        \"doi\": \"10.1093/mnras/staa3199\",\\r\\n        \"categories\": \"astro-ph.IM\",\\r\\n        \"abstract\": \"  Radiative transfer is a notoriously difficult and computationally demanding\\\\nproblem. Yet, it is an indispensable ingredient in nearly all astrophysical and\\\\ncosmological simulations. Choosing an appropriate discretization scheme is a\\\\ncrucial part of the simulation, since it not only determines the direct memory\\\\ncost of the model but also largely determines the computational cost and the\\\\nachievable accuracy. In this paper, we show how an appropriate choice of\\\\ndirectional discretization scheme as well as spatial model mesh can help\\\\nalleviate the computational cost, while largely retaining the accuracy. First,\\\\nwe discuss the adaptive ray-tracing scheme implemented in our 3D radiative\\\\ntransfer library Magritte, that adapts the rays to the spatial mesh and uses a\\\\nhierarchical directional discretization based on HEALPix. Second, we\\\\ndemonstrate how the free and open-source software library Gmsh can be used to\\\\ngenerate high quality meshes that can be easily tailored for Magritte. In\\\\nparticular, we show how the local element size distribution of the mesh can be\\\\nused to optimise the sampling of both analytically and numerically defined\\\\nmodels. Furthermore, we show that when using the output of hydrodynamics\\\\nsimulations as input for a radiative transfer simulation, the number of\\\\nelements in the input model can often be reduced by an order of magnitude,\\\\nwithout significant loss of accuracy in the radiation field. We demonstrate\\\\nthis for two models based on a hierarchical octree mesh resulting from adaptive\\\\nmesh refinement (AMR), as well as two models based on smoothed-particle\\\\nhydrodynamics (SPH) data.\\\\n\",\\r\\n        \"update_date\": \"2020-12-01\"\\r\\n    },\\r\\n    {\\r\\n        \"id\": \"astro-ph/0101561\",\\r\\n        \"authors\": \"Andreu Alibes, Javier Labay and Ramon Canal\",\\r\\n        \"authors_parsed\": [\\r\\n            [\\r\\n                \"Alibes\",\\r\\n                \"Andreu\",\\r\\n                \"\"\\r\\n            ],\\r\\n            [\\r\\n                \"Labay\",\\r\\n                \"Javier\",\\r\\n                \"\"\\r\\n            ],\\r\\n            [\\r\\n                \"Canal\",\\r\\n                \"Ramon\",\\r\\n                \"\"\\r\\n            ]\\r\\n        ],\\r\\n        \"title\": \"Galactic Chemical Evolution and the abundances of lithium, beryllium and\\\\n  boron\",\\r\\n        \"doi\": \"10.1142/9789812810830_0030\",\\r\\n        \"categories\": \"astro-ph\",\\r\\n        \"abstract\": \"  A LiBeB evolution model including Galactic Cosmic Ray nucleosynthesis, the\\\\n$\\\\\\\\nu$-process, novae, AGB and C-stars is presented.

Planck is able, for the first time, to detect\\\\nSZ emission up to r ~ 3 X R_500. We test previously proposed models for the\\\\npressure distribution in clusters against the azimuthally averaged data. We\\\\nfind that the Arnaud et al. universal pressure profile does not fit Coma, and\\\\nthat their pressure profile for merging systems provides a good fit of the data\\\\nonly at r<R_500: by r=2XR_500 it underestimates the observed y profile by a\\\\nfactor of ~2. This may indicate that at these larger radii either i) the\\\\ncluster SZ emission is contaminated by unresolved SZ sources along the line of\\\\nsight or ii) the pressure profile of Coma is higher at r>R_500 than the mean\\\\npressure profile predicted by the simulations. The Planck image shows\\\\nsignificant local steepening of the y profile in two regions about half a\\\\ndegree to the west and to the south-east of the cluster centre. These features\\\\nare consistent with the presence of shock fronts at these radii, and indeed the\\\\nwestern feature was previously noticed in the ROSAT PSPC mosaic as well as in\\\\nthe radio. Using Planck y profiles extracted from corresponding sectors we find\\\\npressure jumps of 4.5+0.4-0.2 and 5.0+1.3-0.1 in the west and southeast,\\\\nrespectively. Assuming Rankine-Hugoniot pressure jump conditions, we deduce\\\\nthat the shock waves should propagate with Mach number M_w=2.03+0.09-0.04 and\\\\nM_se=2.05+0.25-0.02 in the West and Southeast, respectively. Finally, we find\\\\nthat the y and radio-synchrotron signals are quasi-linearly correlated on Mpc\\\\nscales with small intrinsic scatter. This implies either that the energy\\\\ndensity of cosmic-ray electrons is relatively constant throughout the cluster,\\\\nor that the magnetic fields fall off much more slowly with radius than\\\\npreviously thought.\\\\n\",\\r\\n        \"update_date\": \"2015-03-20\"\\r\\n    },\\r\\n    {\\r\\n        \"id\": \"1401.5749\",\\r\\n        \"authors\": \"T.A.

Unfortunately, the accuracy of\\\\nthis method rapidly deteriorates with increasing noise and thus calls for a\\\\nmore robust procedure that combines signal detection and field estimation. We\\\\nintroduce an estimation method that provides not only the effective or mean\\\\nlongitudinal magnetic field from an observed Stokes V profile but also uses the\\\\nnet absolute polarization of the profile to obtain an estimate of the apparent\\\\n(i.e., velocity resolved) absolute longitudinal magnetic field. By combining\\\\nthe COG method with an orthogonal-matching-pursuit (OMP) approach, we were able\\\\nto decompose observed Stokes profiles with an overcomplete dictionary of\\\\nwavelet-basis functions to reliably reconstruct the observed Stokes profiles in\\\\nthe presence of noise. The elementary wave functions of the sparse\\\\nreconstruction process were utilized to estimate the effective longitudinal\\\\nmagnetic field and the apparent absolute longitudinal magnetic field. A\\\\nmultiresolution analysis complements the OMP algorithm to provide a robust\\\\ndetection and estimation method.

We use the MUSE\\\\ndata to derive the star-formation history (SFH) and accurately measure the\\\\nstellar and ionized-gas kinematics of NGC7742 in its nuclear, bulge, ring, and\\\\ndisk regions. We map the previously known gas counter-rotation well outside the\\\\nring region and deduce the presence of a slightly warped inner disk, which is\\\\ninclined ~6 degrees compared to the outer disk. The gas-disk inclination is\\\\nwell constrained from the kinematics; the derived inclination 13.7 $\\\\\\\\pm$ 0.4\\\\ndegrees agrees well with that derived from photometry and from what one expects\\\\nusing the inverse Tully-Fisher relation. We find a prolonged SFH in the ring\\\\nwith stellar populations as old as 2-3 Gyr and an indication that the star\\\\nformation triggered by the minor merger event was delayed in the disk compared\\\\nto the ring. There are two separate stellar components: an old population that\\\\ncounter-rotates with the gas, and a young one, concentrated to the ring, that\\\\nco-rotates with the gas. We recover the kinematics of the old stars from a\\\\ntwo-component fit, and show that combining the old and young stellar\\\\npopulations results in the erroneous average velocity of nearly zero found from\\\\na one-component fit. The superior spatial resolution and large field of view of\\\\nMUSE allow us to establish the kinematics and SFH of the nuclear ring in NGC\\\\n7742.

Trailing the \\\\\"normal\\\\\" profile\\\\npeak there is an \\\\\"intermittent\\\\\" peak and these components are flanked by two\\\\nadditional components showing very erratic \\\\\"RRAT-like\\\\\" emission. Both the\\\\nintermittent and RRAT-like events are extremely rare and are preceded by a\\\\nlarge amplitude glitch in the spin-down parameters. The post-glitch spin-down\\\\nrate is smaller than the pre-glitch rate. This type of relaxation is very\\\\nunusual for the pulsar population as a whole, but is observed in the glitch\\\\nrecovery of a RRAT. The abnormal emission behaviour in PSR J1119-6127 was\\\\nobserved up to three months after the epoch of the large glitch, suggestive of\\\\nchanges in the magnetospheric conditions during the fast part of the recovery\\\\nprocess. We argue that both the anomalous recoveries and the emission changes\\\\ncould be related to reconfigurations of the magnetic field. Apart from the\\\\nglitches, the spin-down of PSR J1119-6127 is relatively stable, allowing us to\\\\nrefine the measurement of the braking index (n=2.684\\\\\\\\pm0.002) using more than\\\\n12 years of timing data. The properties of this pulsar are discussed in light\\\\nof the growing evidence that RRATs do not form a distinct class of pulsar, but\\\\nrather are a combination of different extreme emission types seen in other\\\\nneutron stars. Different sub-classes of the RRATs can potentially be separated\\\\nby calculating the lower limit on the modulation index of their emission. We\\\\nspeculate that if the abnormal behaviour in PSR J1119-6127 is indeed glitch\\\\ninduced then there might exist a population of neutron stars which only become\\\\nvisible in the radio band for a short duration in the immediate aftermath of\\\\nglitch activity. These neutron stars will be visible in the radio band as\\\\nsources that only emit some clustered pulses every so many years.\\\\n\",\\r\\n        \"update_date\": \"2015-05-20\"\\r\\n    },\\r\\n    {\\r\\n        \"id\": \"2002.07260\",\\r\\n        \"authors\": \"Annalisa Calamida (1), Alice Zocchi (2), Giuseppe Bono (3 and 4), Ivan\\\\n  Ferraro (4), Alessandra Mastrobuono-Battisti (5), Abhijit Saha (6), Giacinto\\\\n  Iannicola (4), Armin Rest (1 and 7), Giovanni Strampelli (8 and 7), Alfredo\\\\n  Zenteno (9) ((1) Space Telescope Science Institute - AURA, Baltimore, USA (2)\\\\n  ESA/ESTEC, Noordwijk, Netherlands, (3) Universita\\' di Roma Tor Vergata, Rome,\\\\n  Italy, (4) INAF - Osservatorio Astronomico di Roma, Rome, Italy, (5) Max\\\\n  Planck Institute for Astronomy, Heidelberg, Germany, (6) National Optical\\\\n  Astronomy Observatory - AURA, Tucson, USA, (7) Johns Hopkins University,\\\\n  Baltimore, USA, (8) University of La Laguna, Santa Cruz de Tenerife, Spain,\\\\n  (9) Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory, La Serena, Chile)\",\\r\\n        \"authors_parsed\": [\\r\\n            [\\r\\n                \"Calamida\",\\r\\n                \"Annalisa\",\\r\\n                \"\",\\r\\n                \"3 and 4\"\\r\\n            ],\\r\\n            [\\r\\n                \"Zocchi\",\\r\\n                \"Alice\",\\r\\n                \"\",\\r\\n                \"3 and 4\"\\r\\n            ],\\r\\n            [\\r\\n                \"Bono\",\\r\\n                \"Giuseppe\",\\r\\n                \"\",\\r\\n                \"3 and 4\"\\r\\n            ],\\r\\n            [\\r\\n                \"Ferraro\",\\r\\n                \"Ivan\",\\r\\n                \"\",\\r\\n                \"1 and 7\"\\r\\n            ],\\r\\n            [\\r\\n                \"Mastrobuono-Battisti\",\\r\\n                \"Alessandra\",\\r\\n                \"\",\\r\\n                \"1 and 7\"\\r\\n            ],\\r\\n            [\\r\\n                \"Saha\",\\r\\n                \"Abhijit\",\\r\\n                \"\",\\r\\n                \"1 and 7\"\\r\\n            ],\\r\\n            [\\r\\n                \"Iannicola\",\\r\\n                \"Giacinto\",\\r\\n                \"\",\\r\\n                \"1 and 7\"\\r\\n            ],\\r\\n            [\\r\\n                \"Rest\",\\r\\n                \"Armin\",\\r\\n                \"\",\\r\\n                \"1 and 7\"\\r\\n            ],\\r\\n            [\\r\\n                \"Strampelli\",\\r\\n                \"Giovanni\",\\r\\n                \"\",\\r\\n                \"8 and 7\"\\r\\n            ],\\r\\n            [\\r\\n                \"Zenteno\",\\r\\n                \"Alfredo\",\\r\\n                \"\"\\r\\n            ]\\r\\n        ],\\r\\n        \"title\": \"The not so simple stellar system Omega Cen.

The unprecedented\\\\nphotometric accuracy and field coverage allowed us to confirm the different\\\\nspatial distribution of blue and red main-sequence stars, and of red-giant\\\\nbranch (RGB) stars with different metallicities. The ratio of the number of\\\\nblue to red main-sequence stars shows that the blue main-sequence\\\\nsub-population has a more extended spatial distribution compared to the red\\\\nmain-sequence one, and the frequency of blue main-sequence stars increases at a\\\\ndistance of $\\\\\\\\sim$ 20 arcmin from $\\\\\\\\omega$ Cen center. Similarly, the more\\\\nmetal-rich RGB stars show a more extended spatial distribution compared to the\\\\nmore metal-poor ones in the outskirts of the cluster. Moreover, the centers of\\\\nthe distributions of metal-rich and metal-poor RGB stars are shifted in\\\\ndifferent directions with respect to the geometrical center of $\\\\\\\\omega$ Cen. We\\\\nconstructed stellar density profiles for the blue and red main-sequence stars;\\\\nthey confirm that the blue main-sequence sub-population has a more extended\\\\nspatial distribution compared to the red main-sequence one in the outskirts of\\\\n$\\\\\\\\omega$ Cen, as found based on the star number ratio.

Methods: We derive near-infrared dust extinction maps for 23 molecular\\\\ncloud complexes, using the \\\\\"nicest\\\\\" colour excess mapping technique and data\\\\nfrom the 2MASS archive. The extinction maps are then used to examine the column\\\\ndensity PDFs in the clouds. Results: The column density PDFs of most molecular\\\\nclouds are well-fitted by log-normal functions at low column densities (0.5 mag\\\\n< A_v < 3-5 mag). However, at higher column densities prominent, power-law-like\\\\nwings are common. In particular, we identify a trend among the PDFs: active\\\\nstar-forming clouds always have prominent non-log-normal wings. In contrast,\\\\nclouds without active star formation resemble log-normals over the whole\\\\nobserved column density range, or show only low excess of higher column\\\\ndensities. This trend is also reflected in the cumulative PDFs, showing that\\\\nthe fraction of high column density material is significantly larger in\\\\nstar-forming clouds. These observations are in agreement with an evolutionary\\\\ntrend where turbulent motions are the main cloud-shaping mechanism for\\\\nquiescent clouds, but the density enhancements induced by them quickly become\\\\ndominated by gravity (and other mechanisms) which is strongly reflected by the\\\\nshape of the column density PDFs. The dominant role of the turbulence is\\\\nrestricted to the very early stages of molecular cloud evolution, comparable to\\\\nthe onset of active star formation in the clouds.\\\\n\",\\r\\n        \"update_date\": \"2015-05-14\"\\r\\n    },\\r\\n    {\\r\\n        \"id\": \"1711.08176\",\\r\\n        \"authors\": \"Jiguang Lu, Enping Zhou, Xiaoyu Lai and Renxin Xu\",\\r\\n        \"authors_parsed\": [\\r\\n            [\\r\\n                \"Lu\",\\r\\n                \"Jiguang\",\\r\\n                \"\"\\r\\n            ],\\r\\n            [\\r\\n                \"Zhou\",\\r\\n                \"Enping\",\\r\\n                \"\"\\r\\n            ],\\r\\n            [\\r\\n                \"Lai\",\\r\\n                \"Xiaoyu\",\\r\\n                \"\"\\r\\n            ],\\r\\n            [\\r\\n                \"Xu\",\\r\\n                \"Renxin\",\\r\\n                \"\"\\r\\n            ]\\r\\n        ],\\r\\n        \"title\": \"Causal propagation of signal in strangeon matter\",\\r\\n        \"doi\": null,\\r\\n        \"categories\": \"astro-ph.HE\",\\r\\n        \"abstract\": \"  The state equation of strangeon matter is very stiff due to the\\\\nnon-relativistic nature of and the repulsing interaction between the particles,\\\\nand pulsar masses as high as $\\\\\\\\sim 3M_\\\\\\\\odot$ would be expected.

Without knowledge of the cluster redshift a Bayesian\\\\nanalysis of the AMI, CARMA and joint AMI & CARMA uv-data is used to quantify\\\\nthe detection significance and parameterise both the physical and observational\\\\nproperties of the cluster whilst accounting for the statistics of primary CMB\\\\nanisotropies, receiver noise and radio sources. The joint analysis of the AMI &\\\\nCARMA uv-data was performed with two parametric physical cluster models: the\\\\n{\\\\\\\\beta}-model; and the model described in Olamaie et al. 2012 with the pressure\\\\nprofile fixed according to Arnaud et al. 2010. The cluster mass derived from\\\\nthese different models is comparable but our Bayesian evidences indicate a\\\\npreference for the {\\\\\\\\beta}-profile which we, therefore, use throughout our\\\\nanalysis. From the CARMA data alone we obtain a Bayesian probability of\\\\ndetection ratio of 12.8:1 when assuming that a cluster exists within our search\\\\narea; alternatively assuming that Jenkins et al. 2001 accurately predicts the\\\\nnumber of clusters as a function of mass and redshift, the Bayesian probability\\\\nof detection is 0.29:1. From the analysis of the AMI or AMI & CARMA data the\\\\nprobability of detection ratio exceeds 4.5x10^3:1. Performing a joint analysis\\\\nof the AMI & CARMA data with a physical cluster model we derive the total mass\\\\ninternal to r200 as MT,200 = 4.1x10^14Msun. Using a phenomenological\\\\n{\\\\\\\\beta}-model to quantify the temperature decrement as a function of angular\\\\ndistance we find a central SZ temperature decrement of 170{\\\\\\\\mu}K in the AMI &\\\\nCARMA data. The SZ decrement in the CARMA data is weaker than expected and we\\\\nspeculate that this is a consequence of the cluster morphology. In a\\\\nforthcoming study we will assess the impact of cluster morphology on the SZ\\\\ndecrements that are observed with interferometers such as AMI and CARMA.\\\\n\",\\r\\n        \"update_date\": \"2015-06-16\"\\r\\n    }\\r\\n]'}\n"
